# Stage records

These documents describe implemented library-first stages. They summarize
contracts and sanitized evidence without reproducing audit transcripts or
protected rows. A DEVELOPMENT candidate is not accepted until a fresh
independent review records acceptance.

| 4 | [Lowercase canonical forms](STAGE04_LOWERCASE_CANONICAL.md) | IMPLEMENTED CANDIDATE — RUN PENDING | NOT STARTED |

Stages 5–19 remain documented only in [the pipeline specification](../PIPELINE.md)
because they have not started.
